Heerrooo!

I typed some comments in the thingy explaining how stuff works to the best of my knowledge.
I suggest you go in the order App.js -> index.html -> Home.js -> Wasteitem.js -> Confirmation.js -> History.js

Anything that's unclear, just text me or something hopefully I know what's going on :P


Cheers!
