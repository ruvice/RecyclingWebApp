## About Me
This project was created for CZ2006 and CZ3002. 

### Brief description
It is a recycling web-app where users can recycle their unwanted stuff with the option to book a doorstep collection. Users have profiles, to which points are awarded whenever they recycle. These points can be used to redeem rewards. Users can level up their profile based on the cumulative points earned.

### Social Media-esque
Users can utilise a Twitter-like social media feed on the platform to post anything under the sun. They can also share their most recent recycling "transaction" on social media platforms like Facebook.

### Email notifications
Automated email notifications are sent whenever a user books a collection service. Emails are also sent whenever a reward is redeemed, containing relevant details.

### Teachable Machine
This web app implements a Teachable Machine, which aids in image recognition. This allows users to present the object they wish to recycle and the web app would be able to identify the type of recyclable shown.

### Chatbot
This web app implements a chatbot, which allows users to ask recycling-related questions.

### Backend
The backend is hosted on Google's Firebase. This includes hosting and database management.
